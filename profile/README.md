# 👋 Welcome to MAGAX – Make Altcoins Great Again Xplosion

**MAGAX** is the first AI-powered *Meme-to-Earn* token designed to reward creators and early amplifiers for viral content. Combining smart contracts, trust-scored AI analysis, and a hybrid presale model, MAGAX aims to build a sustainable meme economy for Web3.

## 🔍 What is MAGAX?

MAGAX brings together memes, artificial intelligence, and decentralized rewards into a single protocol:

### 🎯 Meme-to-Earn Engine
Creators earn `$MAGAX` when their memes go viral. Early amplifiers who help spread content are rewarded through a smart contract-based referral system.

### 🤖 AI-Enhanced Engagement Scoring
Dynamic Trust Indicators (DTI) use AI to assess authenticity. Spam bots, click farms, and inorganic engagement are filtered out — ensuring that real virality is what gets rewarded.

### 🔐 Secure 50-Stage Presale Architecture
A hybrid presale model:
- **Stages 1–5**: Off-chain with wallet-tracked purchases
- **Stages 6–50**: On-chain via audited smart contracts
Supports referral rewards, vesting, and anti-fraud infrastructure.

### 🧠 Loomint Platform
The application layer for MAGAX:
- Meme discovery and ranking
- Reward claiming and dashboards
- Submission tools and analytics

### 🤝 Community-First Support
- Live chat and wallet-linked help
- Automated fraud detection
- Easy claim tracking and real-time notifications
